# Welcome to Spade!

This is a project made so I can have fun and learn about DLL Injection. 
THIS IS FOR OFFLINE FUN AND OFFLINE FUN ONLY!!

# Notice
1. This requires that you strip RuntimeBroker from its Exploit Protection that is in relation to shutting down when inserting custom functions/modules. DO THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK!
2. When debugging Gravel.exe, make sure to specify the process id via its flag as the following (without the "<" and ">"): "-pid <ProcessID>"
